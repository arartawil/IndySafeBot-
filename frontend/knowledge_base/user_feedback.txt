Q: "What should I do if a volcano near me erupts?
A: Move away from the volcano, especially from valleys and rivers that could channel lava flows, ash, or mudslides (lahars).Q: What are the long-term health risks after a major flood event?
A: After a major flood, long-term health risks include exposure to waterborne diseases like cholera, hepatitis A, and leptospirosis due to contaminated water, as well as respiratory problems caused by mold growth in damp buildings. Prolonged exposure to floodwaters can also lead to skin infections and increased mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue and malaria. Additionally, many survivors experience psychological effects such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can persist long after the flood has ended.
