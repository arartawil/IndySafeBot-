Floods are among the most common and destructive natural disasters. They can occur due to heavy rainfall, dam failure, rapid snowmelt, or storm surges in coastal areas. Floods pose a significant threat to human life, property, and the environment. Understanding how to prepare for, respond to, and recover from flood events is essential for individuals and communities.

Types of Floods:
1. Flash Floods – Sudden and intense floods that occur within six hours of heavy rainfall.
2. River Floods – Overflow of riverbanks due to prolonged rain or melting snow.
3. Coastal Floods – Caused by storm surges or tsunamis.
4. Urban Floods – Result from inadequate drainage after heavy rain in city areas.

Before a Flood:
- Check flood risk in your area and stay informed via alerts.
- Prepare an emergency kit.
- Elevate electrical items and install sump pumps.
- Have an evacuation plan.

During a Flood:
- Evacuate if instructed.
- Avoid walking or driving in floodwaters.
- Move to higher ground.
- Stay tuned to emergency information.

After a Flood:
- Return home only when safe.
- Avoid contact with floodwater.
- Document damage and clean thoroughly.
- Watch for electrical hazards.
