Volcanoes are geological structures where molten rock, gases, and ash escape from the Earth’s crust. Eruptions can vary in scale and type and cause damage to human life, health, and the environment.

Types of Volcanic Eruptions:
1. Explosive – Ash clouds, pyroclastic flows.
2. Effusive – Slow lava flows.
3. Phreatomagmatic – Steam-driven explosions due to magma-water interaction.

Before an Eruption:
- Identify hazard zones.
- Prepare emergency supplies.
- Follow alerts from monitoring agencies.

During an Eruption:
- Evacuate when instructed.
- Use masks and goggles to protect from ash.
- Stay indoors if ash is falling.

After an Eruption:
- Avoid ash cleanup without proper gear.
- Inspect buildings for damage.
- Beware of secondary hazards (landslides, mudflows).

Health Risks:
- Respiratory issues, eye irritation, burns.
- Long-term gas exposure effects.

Famous Cases:
- Vesuvius (79 AD), Pinatubo (1991), St. Helens (1980)

Monitoring:
- Seismic readings, gas emissions, satellite imagery.

Stay alert, stay prepared, and follow expert guidance to reduce volcanic risk.
